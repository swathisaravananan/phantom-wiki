    """Retrieves answers for a given set of logical queries from the database.

    Args:
        all_queries (list[list[list[str]]]): A structured collection of logical
            queries to be evaluated against the database.
            - Organized as [# of template types] x [# of questions per template] x [subqueries per query].
            - Each query consists of a list of logical predicates expressed as strings.
            - Example:
                ```
                [
                    ["child(Y_2, Y_3)", "sister(Elisa, Y_2)"],
                    ["parent(Y_2, Y_3)", "brother(John, Y_2)"]
                ],
                [
                    ["ancestor(Y_6, Y_7)", "cousin(Mike, Y_6)"]
                    ["ancestor(Y_6, Y_7)", "nephew(Mike, Y_6)"]
                ]
                ```
        db (Database): The database instance used to resolve the queries.
        answers (list[str]): A list of placeholder variables for the expected answers
            for each template type.
            - The length of `answers` must match the number of template types
            (1st dimension of `all_queries`).
            - Example: `["Y_3", "Y_5"]` means extracting `Y_3` for the first template
            type and `Y_5` for the second.
        skip_solution_traces (bool, optional): Flag to skip solution traces, which describe the
            intermediate steps towards final answer. Defaults to False, in which case the
            returned list is non-empty.
        num_procs (int, optional): Number of worker processes for batched query execution.
            1 (default) runs serially; values >1 parallelize via multiprocessing.Pool.


    Returns: (tuple)

        `all_solution_traces` (list[list[list[dict[str, str]]]]):
            - A structured list containing intermediate solution traces for each query.
            - Set up as [# of template types] x [# of questions per template] x [solution traces per query].
            - Matches the structure of `all_queries`.
            - Each trace contains a list of dictionaries mapping query variables to their resolved values.

        `all_final_results` (list[list[list[str]]]):
            - The final resolved answers extracted for each query.
            - Organized as [# of template types] x [# of questions per template] x [results per query].
            - Matches the structure of `all_queries`.
            - Each sublist contains a list of string results.

    Example:
    ```python
    queries = [
        [
            ["child(Y_2, Y_3)", "sister(Elisa, Y_2)"],
            ["parent(Y_2, Y_3)", "brother(John, Y_2)"]
        ],
        [
            ["ancestor(Y_6, Y_7)", "cousin(Mike, Y_6)"]

        ]
    ]
